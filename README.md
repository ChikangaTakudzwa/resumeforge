# Resumeforge

**Note: This app is still a work in progress and hosted on a free plan on Render you might experience slow load times. The OpenAI tokens are limited to 50 so it may not generate a lot of words.**

Resumeforge is a web-based resume generator application built with React, Express, Node.js and OpenAI API. It generates resumes based on the data submitted by the user in a form, and uses natural language processing algorithms to generate compelling and professional resumes that highlight the user's skills, experience and accomplishments.

## Installation
#### To run Resumeforge locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in both the frontend and backend directories.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the backend directory and add your OpenAI API key as `API_KEY`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start` in both the frontend and backend directories.

## Features
#### Resumeforge offers the following features:

1. Responsive UI for ease of use on desktop and mobile devices.
2. User-friendly form to collect the user's basic information and work history.
3. Automated resume generation with OpenAI API.
4. Clean, professional and customizable resume templates. *coming soon*
5. Resume preview before downloading or printing.

## Usage

To use Resumeforge, visit [home](https://client-xfby.onrender.com/) and fill out the form with your full name, current position, current length, technologies used, and work history. After submitting the form, you will be directed to a loading screen while the app generates your resume. Once the resume is generated, you will be redirected to the generated resume.

Resumeforge also offers a resume preview feature that allows users to review their resume before downloading or printing. This feature ensures that the resume is error-free, and that the content is presented in a clear and professional manner.

## API Endpoints
#### Resumeforge offers the following API endpoints:

`https://resumeforge.onrender.com/resume/create` : This endpoint is used to generate the resume. It expects a POST request with the following data:
```
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "currentPosition": "Software Engineer",
  "currentLength": "2 years",
  "technologiesUsed": ["React", "Node.js", "Express"],
  "workHistory": [
    {
      "position": "Software Engineer",
      "company": "Acme Corp",
    }
  ]
}
```

## Limitations

Resumeforge is still a work in progress, and there are some limitations to be aware of. Due to the limitations of the OpenAI API, resumes generated by Resumeforge may be limited in length and may not be as detailed as manually written resumes. Additionally, the current version of Resumeforge is deployed on free render infrastructure which may result in slow loading speeds when visiting the home page.
